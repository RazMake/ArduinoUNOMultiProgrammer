# BOM
This adapter is very simple, it does not really have additional components.

# Circuit
![ATTiny85 Flash Electrical Diagram](https://github.com/RazMake/ArduinoUNOMultiProgrammer/blob/master/Hardware/ATTiny85Circuit.png?raw=true)  
You can find the KiCad Project [here](), containing the electrical diagram and the PCB design.  
The same project also contains the [Gerber files](), if you want to go ahead and directly order the board for yourself.  

# Manufacturing
I have used both [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/quote#/?orderType=1&stencilWidth=100&stencilLength=100&stencilCounts=5&stencilLayer=2&stencilPly=1.6&steelmeshSellingPriceRecordNum=A8256537-5522-491C-965C-646F5842AEC9&purchaseNumber=)
and [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/orderonline.aspx) and they both produced excellent quality PCBs at relatively reasonable prices.  
Both these sites only allow a minimum of 5 copies ordered. It takes a little over a week to receive the PCBs.  
If you want european PCBs, you could use [these](https://www.eurocircuits.com/) guys, but they're more expensive than any of the other two.
They also can make one-offs, but at least sometimes their price for one is more than for a set of 5 on the chinese sites above.
*Note: **[This](https://pcbshopper.com/)** site allows you to compare prices for multiple sources.*
